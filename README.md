# Ola-Driver-Churn-Analysis
CloudyML Internship Project | Power BI & Python

This repository contains my analysis of Ola's driver churn data, completed during my internship at CloudyML. The project combines Python's analytical capabilities and Power BI's visualization tools to understand and address high driver attrition rates.

## Project Overview
* Objective: Analyze driver churn data (2019â€“2020) to identify key factors influencing attrition and develop actionable strategies to retain drivers.
## Tools Used:
* Python: For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and generating insights.
* Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize churn trends, driver demographics, and city-wise performance.
## Key Features
## Python Scripts:
* Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature engineering.
* Exploratory analysis: Insights into tenure, income patterns, and churn drivers.
* Visualizations: Churn rate by age group, city, and performance metrics.
## Power BI Dashboards:
* Driver demographics distribution.
* Churn rate trends and key performance indicators.
* City-specific insights and actionable recommendations.
##Highlights
* Analyzed data from 2,381 drivers, revealing a churn rate of 68%, with most drivers leaving within their first year.
* Identified key factors driving attrition, including low ratings, limited income growth, and shorter tenure.
* Proposed retention strategies like performance-based incentives, flexible schedules, and city-focused initiatives.

##Outcome
This project showcases a data-driven approach to solving real-world business challenges, offering Ola strategies to reduce churn and build a loyal driver base.
